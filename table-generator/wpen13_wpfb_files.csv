Basically the tab is adapted according to the first previous line which delivers
a suitable tab anchor point (default is to consider the preceeding 20 lines).
It also works with multi-line selections.

Perhaps this is of use for someone.

（主にキーボード操作で）一覧を表示して編集する文書を切り替えます。
WindowsのAlt+Tabによるアプリケーション切り替え機能のようなものです。
タブ有効時に同一グループ（同一ウィンドウ）の文書が対象となります。
また、ショートカットキー割り当ては必須です。

○使い方
・文書の選択
Ctrl+TabかCtrl+Shift+Tabを押すと、Ctrlを押している間、文書一覧を表示します。
この状態で、キー操作で切り替え先の文書を選択し、Ctrlを離すかEnterキーを押すと選択された文書に切り替えます。
選択切り替えは、
Ctrl+Tab 次の文書
Ctrl+Shift+Tab 前の文書
Ctrl+カーソル下 次の文書
Ctrl+カーソル上 前の文書
などです。
マウスでも選べるかと思います。

・インクリメンタルサーチ
キーボードでファイル名を入力するとカーソル位置から最初に一致するものを選択します。
設定で、前方一致か部分一致かを選択できます。

<strong>本プラグインは EmEditor 最新版では動作しません。</strong>

○概要
EmEditor8系をIMEの持つ前後参照変換に対応させます。
前後参照変換とは、変換時にすでに確定されている前後の文章を参照して変換を行う機能です。
たとえば、
花が 布を 時間を
という文字列があるとき、それぞれの後ろで「さいた」と入力しを変換すると、
花が咲いた 布を裂いた 時間を割いた
と変換されます。

○既知の問題点
このプラグインはいろいろと制限事項があります。
・IMEが古すぎると前後参照変換機能がないことがあります。
この場合このプラグインは役に立ちません。
・MS-IMEと「詳細なテキストサービスのサポートをプログラムのすべてに拡張する」が有効な状態のでは動作しません。
WindowsXPでは、この機能はデフォルトで向こうなのでいじってなければ使えるとは思いますが、
WindowsVista以降のOSでは無効にできないので、MS-IMEでは使えないことになります。
いつか、できたら何とかしたいです。
・EmEditor Ver9 では、本体が対応しているので使わないでください。
・一部の他のプラグインと相性が悪いかもしれません。
ちょっと特殊な手法を使っているので、同じ手法を使っているプラグインがあったら、ひょっとしたら問題が出るかもしれません。
その場合は本プラグインの使用はあきらめてください。

論理行単位でランダムに行を入れ替える、テキストエディタ「EmEditor」32ビット版専用プラグインです。重複しない乱数データの作成や、シャッフル結果の上何行を抽出など、ランダム性が要求されるテキストデータの加工にお使いください。

【インストール】
ファイルを解凍するとファイルが展開されます。これをEmEditorが指定するプラグインフォルダ（通常は「C:Program FilesEmEditorPlugIns」）にコピーしてください。プラグインが正しく認識されれば、プラグインリストに「LineShuffle／行単位でシャッフル」の項目・アイコンが追加されます。

【使い方】
書き込み可能かつ、２行以上のテキストデータが開かれているとき、このプラグインが使えるようになります。プラグインを選択すれば、あとは自動でシャッフルが行われます。１万行を超えるテキストデータの場合、シャッフル後のテキストデータ調整に時間がかかりますので、非常に多い行数をもつデータに対して実行する場合は、強制終了させるリスクを考慮し、あらかじめ編集中のテキストデータを保存しておくことをお薦めします。

【アンインストール】
ファイルを直接削除してください。レジストリ等には関与していないため、これだけでクリーンなアンインストールが完了します。

naoExecMacroOnEventは、EmEditorのプラグインです。
naoExecMacroOnEventを導入すると、EmEditor使用時に発生するさまざまなイベ
ントに対して、マイマクロを関連付けることができます。関連付けしたマクロは
それぞれのイベントが発生した際に、自動的に実行されます。

このプラグインの提供する機能は非常に「単純なモノ」ですが、その使い方に
よっては、EmEditorを「簡単な手続き」で非常に「便利なモノ」にカスタマイズ
することできます。

ただし、その反面、簡単な手続きで「（ある意味）危険な機能を組み込むコト」
もできます。『使用にあたって注意すること』をよく読んでから使ってください。

■naoExecMacroOnEventでできること
○　１２種類のイベントにマイマクロを関連付けることができます。
○　一つのイベントに複数個のマクロを関連付けることができます。
○　関連付けられたマクロをイベント発生時に自動的に実行します。
○　複数個のマクロを関連付けた場合は、先頭から順に実行します。
○　実行したマクロのログをとることができます。
○　一時的にプラグインの機能を停止させることができます。

■関連付けられるイベントの一覧
以下の１２個のイベントにマクロを関連付けられます。

イベント名 記号 説明
---------------------+---+----------------------------------------------
EVENT_SEL_CHANGED $$ テキストの選択状態が変更された時
EVENT_CARET_MOVED $$ カーソル位置が移動した時
EVENT_MODIFIED $$ 更新状態が変更された時
EVENT_SCROLL $$ スクロールバーの位置が変更された時
EVENT_CONFIG_CHANGED 現在の設定のプロパティが変更された時
EVENT_CHANGE $$ テキストの内容が変更された時
EVENT_CREATE EmEditorが起動した直後とプラグインを追加した時
EVENT_CLOSE EmEditorが終了する直前とプラグインが開放された時
EVENT_KILL_FOCUS フォーカスを失った時
EVENT_SET_FOCUS フォーカスを取得した時
EVENT_CHAR $$ 文字が挿入された時
EVENT_FILE_OPENED ファイルを開いた直後

記号列に$$を記載しているイベントは、頻繁に発生する性質のものであるため、
マクロの関連付け操作を行う際に、問い合わせを行います。

■！！使用にあたって注意すること！！
以下に注意点を列挙します。

○マクロの関連付けは、マクロ自体が正常に動作するモノであることを十分確
認した上で行ってください。
本プラグインでは、マクロの自動実行機能を提供するため、悪意のある制
作者の作ったマクロを検証もせず、関連付けたりすると利用者のあなたに
被害が及ぶ場合があります。
○頻繁に発生するイベントには、実行に時間のかかるマクロを関連付けないで
ください。EmEditorのレスポンスが悪くなります。
○別のマクロの実行時に、関連付けたマクロが呼び出されることがあります。
○最悪、EmEditorが起動できなくなったら「インストールの仕方」に記述して
いるレジストリキーをレジストリエディタで削除してください。
EmEditorが起動できなくなるケースとして、EVENT_CREATEイベントに非常
に時間のかかるマクロを関連付けしているケースが考えられます。

以上、悪い面ばかり書き連ねましたが、良い面は非常に強力ですので、有益に
使って頂ければと思います。

■動作環境
基本的に、EmEditorの動作環境に準じます。
ただし、作者が外国語が苦手なので日本語版Windowsのみが対象です。

■ファイルの内容
ダウンロードしたファイル内には次の２つのファイルを含んでいます。
・naoExecMacroOnEvent.dll プログラム本体
・naoExecMacroOnEvent.txt このファイル

■インストールの仕方
naoExecMacroOnEvent.dllをEmEditorのPlugInsフォルダ
（通常、C:Program FilesEmEditorPlugIns）にコピーするだけです。
なお、naoExecMacroOnEvent.txtもコピーしておくことをお奨めします。

本プラグインではレジストリの以下の場所を記憶領域として使用します。

<strong>本プラグインは EmEditor 最新版では動作しません。</strong>

○概要
EmEditor8系をIMEの持つ前後参照変換に対応させます。
前後参照変換とは、変換時にすでに確定されている前後の文章を参照して変換を行う機能です。
たとえば、
花が 布を 時間を
という文字列があるとき、それぞれの後ろで「さいた」と入力しを変換すると、
花が咲いた 布を裂いた 時間を割いた
と変換されます。

○既知の問題点
このプラグインはいろいろと制限事項があります。
・IMEが古すぎると前後参照変換機能がないことがあります。
この場合このプラグインは役に立ちません。
・MS-IMEと「詳細なテキストサービスのサポートをプログラムのすべてに拡張する」が有効な状態のでは動作しません。
WindowsXPでは、この機能はデフォルトで向こうなのでいじってなければ使えるとは思いますが、
WindowsVista以降のOSでは無効にできないので、MS-IMEでは使えないことになります。
いつか、できたら何とかしたいです。
・EmEditor Ver9 では、本体が対応しているので使わないでください。
・一部の他のプラグインと相性が悪いかもしれません。
ちょっと特殊な手法を使っているので、同じ手法を使っているプラグインがあったら、ひょっとしたら問題が出るかもしれません。
その場合は本プラグインの使用はあきらめてください。",",,",,"1.0.1",,,,"free",,,"0","1","0","4","Plug-ins (64-bit)","0","0","0","0","0","0","3483","3","1142","0","0","162.120.154.79","2023-08-13 13:21:09","0","0",,,

論理行単位でランダムに行を入れ替える、テキストエディタ「EmEditor」64ビット版専用プラグインです。重複しない乱数データの作成や、シャッフル結果の上何行を抽出など、ランダム性が要求されるテキストデータの加工にお使いください。

【インストール】
ファイルを解凍するとファイルが展開されます。これをEmEditorが指定するプラグインフォルダ（通常は「C:Program FilesEmEditorPlugIns」）にコピーしてください。プラグインが正しく認識されれば、プラグインリストに「LineShuffle／行単位でシャッフル」の項目・アイコンが追加されます。

【使い方】
書き込み可能かつ、２行以上のテキストデータが開かれているとき、このプラグインが使えるようになります。プラグインを選択すれば、あとは自動でシャッフルが行われます。１万行を超えるテキストデータの場合、シャッフル後のテキストデータ調整に時間がかかりますので、非常に多い行数をもつデータに対して実行する場合は、強制終了させるリスクを考慮し、あらかじめ編集中のテキストデータを保存しておくことをお薦めします。

【アンインストール】
ファイルを直接削除してください。レジストリ等には関与していないため、これだけでクリーンなアンインストールが完了します。

CreatePluginTemplateは、EmEditorPluginの「ソースコード」「リソース」「プ
ロジェクト」ファイルを簡単な手順で生成するツールです。
生成するソース一式は、Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 （以降の）専用のソースコー
ドとなります。他のコンパイラは未対応となりますが、その分 MFC などを標準で
に利用できるようになっています。

■CreatePluginTemplateでできること
○　プラグイン名、プラグインの説明、著作者名を入力するだけで、指定された
場所に、ほぼ完成したプラグインのテンプレートを生成します。
○　テンプレート生成後は、実装したい機能にだけ集中して作業できます。
○　デバッグビルド時にEmEditorのPluginsフォルダに自動でDLLをコピーします。
○　VC++6.0に対応したプロジェクトファイルを生成します。
○　VC++7.0,7.1(.NET)でもプロジェクトを開くことができます。

■動作環境
基本的に、EmEditorの動作環境に準じます。
ただし、作者が外国語が苦手なので日本語版Windowsのみが対象です。

■インストールの仕方
二通りの方法があります。

(1)インストーラ版
CreatePluginTemplateVXXX.exe（XXXはバージョン番号です）をダウンロードし、
実行します。インストール画面が表示されるので、画面の指示に従ってインス
トールを行ってください。

(2)単なる圧縮ファイル版
CreatePluginTemplateVXXX.lzh（XXXはバージョン番号です）をダウンロードし、
適当なフォルダ（c:\Program Files\CreatePluginTemplateなど）に解凍してく
ださい。この方法ではレジストリは一切使用しません。

パソコンの操作に精通されている方は(2)を、そうでない方は(1)を使用するのが
良いと思います。

両者の違いは、(1)がアンインストールに必要な情報をレジストリに書き込むこ
とだけです。アプリケーションの機能には何ら変わることがありません。

■アンインストール
(1)でインストールされた方は、コントロールパネルの「アプリケーションの追
加と削除」から「CreatePluginTemplate」を選んでアンインストールしてくださ
い。

(2)でインストールされた方は、インストールしたフォルダをまるごと削除して
ください。この操作で、完全にアンインストールされます。

プログラム本体はレジストリへの書き込みをしていません。

は 次のように作成してください。
・EmEditorのヘルプを開く
・「プラグインリファレンス」－「ヘッダ（plugin.h）」ページを開きます。
・ヘルプに表示された内容全てを""plugin.h""として保存します。

EmEditor のバージョンアップに伴い、plugin.h は変更される可能性があります。
この場合、plugin.h を更新しなければ新しいバージョンに対応できない可能性
があることを覚えておいてください。

■ヘルプについて
ヘルプはありません。小さなツールなので、今後も作成する予定はありません。
ただし、Webページ上で使い方を紹介する予定です。

In order for EmEditor to support Zen Macros, one only needs to edit the interface portion of Zen Coding, but the core part will need few or no changes.

There are two ways to use Zen Coding for EmEditor Professional. The first method is to utilize the Snippets plug-in. This is the easiest method because it will automatically assign keyboard shortcuts for all the commands, and it allows you to bypass a popup menu.

To install Zen Coding for the Snippets plug-in
==============================================

1. Copy ""zen_emeditor.jsee"" to the My Macros folder. The My Macros folder usually exists under the My Documents folder. However, if you have never used macros before, this folder may not exist already. In that case, you can create My Macros folder under the My Documents folder, and then copy the macro into this folder.

2. If the Snippets custom bar is not visible, Select Snippets on the Tools > Plug-ins (or click the Snippets button on the Plug-ins Toolbar).

3. Right click on the Snippets custom bar to display a menu.

4. Select Import/Export > Import to Root...

5. Select ""zen-coding-en.eesnip"".

6. If you wish to use Zen Coding while the Snippets custom bar is hidden, you can right-click on the Snippets button on the Plug-ins Toolbar (or in the Snippets Custom Bar, select View > Plug-in Properties), and click ""Run Background"".

In the Snippets Custom Bar, you will see a new folder named ""Zen Coding"", and in this folder you will see 17 new macro items. All of these macros are assigned with shortcut keys:

- Balance Tag (Ctrl+Shift+D)
- Decrement number by 0.1 (Ctrl+Shift+Num -)
- Decrement number by 1 (Ctrl+Num -)
- Decrement number by 10 (Shift+Num -)
- Evaluate Math Expression (Ctrl+=)
- Expand Abbreviation (F12)
- Go to Matching Pair (Ctrl+[)
- Increment number by 0.1 (Ctrl+Shift+Num +)
- Increment number by 1 (Ctrl+Num +)
- Increment number by 10 (Shift+Num +)
- Merge Lines (Ctrl+Shift+M)
- Next Edit Point (Ctrl+\)
- Previous Edit Point (Ctrl+Shift+\)
- Remove Tag (Ctrl+Shift+')
- Split/Joint Tag (Ctrl+;)
- Toggle Comment (Alt+/)
- Wrap with Abbreviation (Ctrl+Shift+A)

The shortcut keys described above are for U.S. keyboards. International keyboards may have different key layouts and thus short cuts may be different. You can customize shortcut keys from each snippet properties.

To install Zen Coding as a direct macro
=======================================

1. Copy both ""zen_emeditor.jsee"" and ""zen_popup_menu.jsee"" to the My Macros folder (usually My Documents\My Macros).

2. On the Macros menu, click on ""Select..."", and select ""zen_popup_menu.jsee"".

3. If you wish to assign a keyboard shortcut to run this macro, select ""Properties for All Configuration"" on the Tools menu. Click the Keyboard tab. Select ""My Macros"" on the Category drop-down list, and select ""zen_popup_menu.jsee"". In the ""Press New Shortcut Key"" text box, press your favorite keyboard shortcut, and click the Assign button.

To use Zen Coding
=================

The most frequent action you would use is ""Expand Abbreviation"".

For instance, if you type ""div#name"", and press F12 (if you install as the Snippets), or run the ""zen_popup_menu.jsee"" macro and select ""Expand Abbreviation"", this abbreviation will expand to:
<div id=""name""></div>
